# Redux Boilerplate

A predictable state container for Javascript apps.

Check out [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) in more detail on the official site.

#### Up and running

```
> git clone https://github.com/sammyteahan/redux-boilerplate.git
> cd redux-boilerplate
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### Build for production

There's still some work that needs to be done in `webpack.config.js` here, but running `npm run build` will bundle up everything into a `/build` directory.


#### Style

Everything in `src/sass` is based on [brennens](https://github.com/brennens) boilerplate located [here](https://github.com/brennens/boilerplate).
